# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard  

📌 **Project Objective**  
To design and develop a **Pizza Sales Dashboard in Power BI** using sales data (Jan 2015 – Dec 2015), supported by SQL queries, to deliver insights into **total revenue, orders, pizzas sold, category/size performance, and best/worst sellers**.  

The dashboard helps business stakeholders monitor **Sales KPIs, Daily & Monthly Order Trends, Category/Size Contribution, and Product-Level Performance**, enabling **Data-Driven Decisions** for marketing, inventory, and operations.  

---

📊 **Live Dashboard**  
I created **two interactive dashboards** in Power BI:  
- **Home Section** – Sales KPIs, daily/monthly trends, category/size breakdown  
- **Best/Worst Sellers Section** – Top & bottom pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders.
- **Note:** The dashboard size is comparatively larger than usual. For the best experience, reduce the view to **70%** in Power BI Service — this way you can clearly see all visuals and enjoy exploring the dashboard.

🚨 **Business Problem**  
Pizza chains need clear visibility into **sales performance, category contributions, and product-level insights**. Without analysis, it becomes difficult to:  

- Track **total revenue, orders, and pizzas sold**  
- Identify **busiest days & months** for operations planning  
- Compare **pizza categories and sizes** by sales contribution  
- Analyze **best & worst selling pizzas** by revenue, quantity, and orders  
- Improve **customer targeting and menu optimization**  

---

❓ **Key Questions (KPIs)**  
Based on customer requirements, the following questions were answered via SQL + Power BI:  

- What is the **total revenue, total pizzas sold, and average order value**?  
- What are the **daily and monthly order trends**?  
- How much do different **pizza categories & sizes contribute** to sales?  
- Which are the **top 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders**?  
- Which are the **bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders**?  
- What are the **busiest days & months** for pizza sales?

⚙️ **Process**  

- **Data Import**: Loaded the raw pizza sales dataset into **MS SQL Server**.
